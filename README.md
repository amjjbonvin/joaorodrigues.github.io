# Bonvin Lab webpage based on the Jekyll template [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)

See a [live version of this website](http://joaorodrigues.github.io/) hosted on GitHub.

## Getting Started

Minimal Mistakes takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.
